priority queue  is a stack like structure but it an queue in which when we push the elements it gets sorted automatically.

min heap---------use where we have to find  kth max. value /largest value
            syntax= priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> pq;
            
            
max heap---------use where we have to find  kth min. value /smallest value
           syntax=priority_queue<int> pq;
